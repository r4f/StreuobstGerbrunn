# Naschbaumkarte

Regelmäßig aktualisierte Obstbaumkarte, welche Informationen zu Obstsorten und weitere Daten, wie Größe und Alter des Baums, anzeigt.

## Features
- Fast and simple: Tree data is queried from overpass, which makes regular update of basemap unnecessary.
- Colorful icons show which type of fruit tree species each tree is.
- Size of trees is vizualized for better identification of trees in the field.

## Future features
- Configure, which additional objects shall be drawn on map for better orientation and identification of trees. For example at some points there are benches, street lamps, or power line poles near the trees, which can give orientation.
